# Create a Python file called details.py

# Pseudo code to solve the problem
# This script takes user input for name, age, house number, and street name and prints a sentence with these details

# Get user input for name
user_name = input("Enter your name: ")

# Get user input for age
user_age = input("Enter your age: ")

# Get user input for house number
house_number = input("Enter your house number: ")

# Get user input for street name
street_name = input("Enter your street name: ")
